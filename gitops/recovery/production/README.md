# Production CloudNativePG recovery

This directory is the authoritative recovery path for the production
CloudNativePG database.

It is intentionally outside the active production Argo CD Kustomization.
Never add these recovery Kustomizations to `stack-production`.

## Current production identity
<!-- - Namespace: `production`
- Cluster: `central-postgres-ha`
- Database: `wallabag`
- Owner and login role: `wallabag_user`
- ObjectStore: `minio-postgres-backups`
- Current Barman source identity: `central-postgres-ha`
- StorageClass: `local-path`
- Eligible nodes: `cnpg-ha=true`, currently `server` and `worker-2` -->

Cluster prerequisites must be restored before applying greenfield/
Namespace prod-database
CloudNativePG operator
Barman plugin
ObjectStore oci-postgres-backups
Vault Secrets Operator
prod-database-vault-auth
oci-postgres-dr-credentials-vault
cnpg-wallabag-role-credentials-vault

The active manifest under
`gitops/apps/environments/production/patches/cloudnative-pg/`
is runtime desired state. It is not the initial greenfield entry point because
its Barman plugin writes WAL for the running Cluster.

## Recovery entry points

### Drill

Use `gitops/recovery/production/drill`.

This creates `production/central-postgres-ha-recovery` and can coexist with
the healthy production Cluster.

### Real greenfield recovery

Use `gitops/recovery/production/greenfield`.

This creates `production/central-postgres-ha`, preserving Wallabag's existing
database hostname:

`central-postgres-ha-rw.production.svc.cluster.local`

Do not apply the greenfield Kustomization while an existing
`central-postgres-ha` Cluster is present.

Both entry points:

- begin with one PostgreSQL instance;
- recover database `wallabag`;
- preserve owner `wallabag_user`;
- recover from Barman server `central-postgres-ha`;
- use only nodes labelled `cnpg-ha=true`;
- have no `spec.plugins` section;
- cannot write WAL into the recovery source lineage.

## Required Vault-managed CNPG credential

The active Cluster and both recovery entry points reference:

`production/cnpg-wallabag-credentials-vault`

This Secret is created by Vault Secrets Operator from:

- Vault mount: `kv`
- Vault path: `kubernetes/production/wallabag`
- Vault authentication: `production-vault-auth`
- Kubernetes Secret type: `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`
- Username key: `username`
- Password key: `password`

The Vault source is the same source used by
`production/wallabag-credentials-vault`. The CNPG projection exposes only the
basic-auth keys required by CloudNativePG. Credential values remain in Vault
and are never stored in Git.

This Secret is persistent production desired state. Do not delete it after a
recovery drill. Confirm that its VaultStaticSecret is Ready before creating
either recovery Cluster.

## Recovery drill

Confirm the Vault-managed CNPG credential is Ready, then run:

    kubectl apply -k gitops/recovery/production/drill

    kubectl -n production wait \
      --for=condition=Ready \
      cluster/central-postgres-ha-recovery \
      --timeout=30m

Validate:

- the post-backup WAL marker;
- database `wallabag`;
- owner and role `wallabag_user`;
- table names and exact row counts;
- PostgreSQL extensions;
- password authentication through the recovery RW Service;
- absence of `spec.plugins`;
- continued production health.

After the drill:

    kubectl -n production delete \
      cluster central-postgres-ha-recovery \
      --wait=true

Verify that its pod, PVC, dynamic PV, Services and temporary authentication Job
are also absent.

## Real greenfield recovery

Before recovery:

1. Verify that the old `central-postgres-ha` Cluster no longer exists.
2. Prevent `stack-production` from reconciling the active Cluster manifest.
3. Restore and verify MinIO and `minio-postgres-backups`.
4. Restore and verify Vault Secrets Operator and
   `wallabag-credentials-vault`.
5. Confirm `server` and `worker-2` have `cnpg-ha=true`.
6. Confirm `cnpg-wallabag-credentials-vault` exists, is Ready, and contains username `wallabag_user`.

Start recovery:

    kubectl apply -k gitops/recovery/production/greenfield

    kubectl -n production wait \
      --for=condition=Ready \
      cluster/central-postgres-ha \
      --timeout=30m

Validate the database before enabling WAL archiving or resuming Argo CD.

The initial recovered Cluster intentionally has one instance and no WAL
archiver.

Before resuming `stack-production`, change the active production Cluster's
Barman writer to a new, empty server identity, for example:

    plugins:
      - name: barman-cloud.cloudnative-pg.io
        isWALArchiver: true
        parameters:
          barmanObjectName: minio-postgres-backups
          serverName: central-postgres-ha-recovered-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ

Do not use `central-postgres-ha` as the recovered Cluster's writer identity.
That is the existing non-empty recovery source.

After resuming Argo CD:

1. Confirm the Cluster scales to two healthy instances.
2. Confirm placement on `server` and `worker-2`.
3. Confirm Wallabag returns HTTP 302.
4. Confirm continuous WAL archiving succeeds.
5. Create an immediate backup in the new writer lineage.
6. Update both recovery entry points to use that verified lineage as their
   source for the next disaster.
7. Use another new empty writer identity during the next recovery.

Never enable `cnpg.io/skipEmptyWalArchiveCheck`. Bypassing that protection can
overwrite backup or WAL history.
